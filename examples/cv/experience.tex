    {Dynamics Engineer} % Job title
    {SpaceX} % Organization
    {Hawthorne, CA} % Location
    {April 2015 - December 2015} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Doubled the reliability and halved the time of test specification creation by designing and implementing a data analysis and data visualization software package using mainly Python, Pandas and Numpy. This allowed engineers to work with large data sets more efficiently leading to more accurate test specifications.}
        \item {Deployed Python package to local Pip accessible repository with continuous deployment, automatic testing, and automatic documentation generation using Bamboo, PyLint, Tox, and Sphinx.}
        \item {Deployed a Jupyter Notebook application to AWS GovCloud for Dynamicists to use the Python packageâ€™s data structure, math utilities, data aggregation tools, and data visualization sub-package in a sharable and easily accessible document.}
        \item {Decreased flight risk by writing Python scripts that queried thousands of vibration tests and checked against new testing standards for Flight 21(the rocket that landed) ensuring all vibration susceptible components were safe for flight.}
        \item {Mitigated component susceptibility to high frequency dynamics by working with designers, predicting vibration and shock environments through data aggregation of test and flight data, and implementing vibration tests to qualify hardware before flight.}
      \end{cvitems}

      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Determined shock and vibration environments for propulsion, avionic, and structural components on the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule. Followed by assisting with the testing and verification of these component environments.}
        \item {Improved accuracy of shock environments by implementing and analyzing several large scale shock tests to determine shock susceptibility of components.}
        \item {Improved speed and reliability of data reviews by developing automated reports in Matlab.}
